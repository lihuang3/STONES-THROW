Reviewer 5 of IROS 2014 submission 1

Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents a nonlinear control design for an MRI
robot. The author design the control for multiple permanent
magnets in the MRI controlled by a 3D gradient field.
The control is non linear control based on min-max control
Liapunov control function.
The theoretical control law development is interesting and
thorough.

 (TODO: 2.)
 The authors should be aware of the problem with
such controllers that they cause rapid switching in the
input which is not always applicative in the real world.The
way to avoid this is to add a damping constant in the non
linear control law or to use more advance non linear
control schemes such as sliding modes.
The paper s well written and the equations are explained
well and demonstrated properly.
As for the references, they are adequate. 

 (TODO: 3.)
I would also
quote Abbott's and Menciassi's efforts in magnetically
controlled robots. I prefer that the author will state more
clearly their previous work in this subject. 
All in all a very good paper, considering its scope and
added additional experiments to it int the real world it
can be easily published as a journal paper in addition to
this proceedings.

The authors should consider presenting the input efforts in
the demonstrations
