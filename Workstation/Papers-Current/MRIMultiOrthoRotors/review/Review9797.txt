Reviewer 1 of IROS 2014 submission 1

Comments to the author
======================

This is a very well-done paper. This group has previously
shown that the gradients in a clinical MRI can be used to
apply forces to a magnetic bead, and those forces can be
converted to mechanical torques if the bead is embedded at
the end some moment arm, and thus gradient forces can be
used to power rotary machines inside an MRI, essentially
creating a new type of motor. In this paper, they show that
any number of such motors can be controlled in an
under-actuated fashion using only the three gradient-coil
inputs, provided that none of the motor shafts are
parallel. The authors provide a complete analytical result,
and well as simulations and a case-study in the design of a
3-DOF biopsy-needle system.

I commend the authors on this paper. As someone who also
works on magnetic-manipulation systems, I get very tired of
reviewing papers with no real contribution that advances
the state-of-the-art in our field. This paper makes a real
contribution, it that we now know how to do something that
we couldn't have done before.

I think the assumption that the motor shafts are not
parallel is not restrictive in the slightest. It is
completely reasonable for the authors to make and enforce
such an assumption in a design, and it will not limit the
proposed method in any appreciable way.

(TODO: 1.)  One mistake I found: in equation (2), I'm pretty sure that
the denominators should be dx, dy, dz, and that the
numerators should all be subscript z. Am I thinking about
this wrong? The field always points in the z direction
within the bore, and only its magnitude varies as a
function of position, due to the gradient coils. Hopefully
this type didn't make its way into the remainder of the
derivation.

[[ Thank you for catching this error! Sadly, it also appears in an IJRR article (http://robotics.tch.harvard.edu/publications/pdfs/vartholomeos2013MRI.pdf) ]]

(TODO: 2.) Probably the paper's only weakness is that it doesn't
really provide good experimental data, but the attached
video clearly shows that the method is working in some
simple systems. Since this paper is basically ready to be
submitted for journal publication, I assume that the
authors will include more experimental verification there.

[[True.  this will wait for the Journal version ]]


Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

This is a well-done video, mixing simulations and physical
experiments in an MRI.
