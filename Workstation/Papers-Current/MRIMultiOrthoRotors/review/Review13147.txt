Reviewer 6 of IROS 2014 submission 1

Comments to the author
======================

This paper is about a new idea of motor that uses MRI's
magnetic fields. The paper's novelty are 1) proposal of new
control method to selectively rotate more than 3 motors
with considering interference between motors, 2) estimation
of performance, controllability, design consideration. The
principle of actuation has been published in previous
works. 

Reading this paper was interesting, although the work is
yet in an early stage. It will be necessary to carefully
examine if this idea works in a scanner as well as
maintains the imaging quality. 


 (TODO: 4.)
In practice, the following
may be the technical issues;
1) the linearity of the gradient field out of the imaging
volume won't be good,
2) you'll need to implement brakes to stay the actuators
when it's imaging,
3) effect of mechanical margins vs. singularities (below)
4) efficiency (if it can work quick enough).


 (TODO: 5.)
My concern is the singularity. As in Fig. 3, you can
selectively rotate one motor. But the other two may be in
the unstable condition - minor mechanical margin or minor
noise in gradient field may appear as sudden actuation. 


 (TODO: 6.)
And, I am really, really willing to see the demo video that
many motors are controlled independently and selectively.
Up to three motors in cartecian configuration is already
great. The current video demo has two possible
improvements, 1) show motors are selectively moving and
stopping, 2) rotation is smooth (currently, rotation rate
seems not flat).

Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

I am willing to see how different motors are controlled
selectively, independently.
