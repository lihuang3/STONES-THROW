 Video attachment for "Simultaneously Powering and Controlling Many Actuators With a Clinical MRI Scanner" by Aaron Becker, Ouajdi Felfoul, and Pierre E. Dupont, at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 

 Video shows a Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner powering a motor composed of a steel ball-bearing caged in a rotor arm. Previous work demonstrated it is possible to control one motor, this paper proves that multiple actuators can be controlled simultaneously.  Video shows multiple actuators under open-loop control and the limitations of open-loop due to rotor slipping. Simulations demonstrate a closed-loop controller with global asymptotic stability, both for velocity and position control. Video ends with a simulated 3-axis needle biopsy robot designed for MR-control.
