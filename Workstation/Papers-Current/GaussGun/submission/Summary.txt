Video attachment for "Toward Tissue Penetration by MRI-powered Millirobots Using a Self-Assembled Gauss Gun" by Aaron T. Becker, Ouajdi Felfoul, and Pierre E. Dupont, at the University of Houston, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 
MRI-based navigation and propulsion of millirobots is a promising approach for minimally invasive therapies, but prior techniques have been limited to gradient-based pulling through fluid-filled body lumens.  Video demonstrates a technique for generating large impulsive forces to penetrate tissue, based on navigating multiple robots to a desired location and using self-assembly to trigger the conversion of magnetic potential energy into sufficient kinetic energy to achieve penetration. Video shows three experiments in a clinical MRI scanner.
