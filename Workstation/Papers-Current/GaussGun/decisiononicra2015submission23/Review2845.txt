Comments to the author
======================

This paper describes the design of an MRI propulsion based
robot for minimally invasive surgery. Each component of the
robot is comprised of two spheres that act as magnets when
exposed to a magnetic field. The proposed approach involves
allowing individual components to self-assemble. Using a
gauss gun concept, the spheres can be fired against each
other, conveying their magnetic potential energy into
kinematic energy, which results in high puncture force
capability of the robot.

The paper is well written and the concept is explained
clearly. The introduction gives strong motivation for the
clinical applications and clearly identifies the novelty of
the research. A fairly comprehensive overview of the
theoretical foundation is provided.

The paper could be improved if more details about the
design considerations of the device were provided in the
design section. More importantly, the experimental section
in its current state is weak and there lacks a clear
connection between the theory and the experiments. It
would be helpful to explicitly reinforce how the
experiments tie-in with the theory and/or introduction
topics. Although the motivation of the paper was on the use
of high velocities to generate the forces necessary to
puncture tissue, the experimental test focused on
penetration depth rather than the puncture force/velocity.

Despite these issues, overall the concept presented in the
paper is interesting, and the paper is suitable for
publication.

Other minor comments:
- Introduction, Paragraph 5: "tissue penetration force"
should be referred to as "tissue puncture force"
- It would be informative to describe how the critical
distance shown just after equation (5) was considered for
the design of the device
- Finding a way to quantify the results provided in section
IV B & IV C would strengthen the paper
- It would be helpful to add labels in Figures 10 & 11
- In Figure 10, arrows could be used to indicate how the
component evolves from one image to the next

Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

The video was an informative supplement to the paper, and
it was very helpful to see the device in motion. A minor
suggestion would be to slow down the text at the start to
match with the voice-over, but it is fine as is.
