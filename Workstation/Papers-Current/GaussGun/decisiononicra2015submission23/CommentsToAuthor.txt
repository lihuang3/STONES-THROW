Overall this is strong paper and an interesting research
project.  The paper is very well-written. The paper could
be strengthened by adding labels to components in the
figures (Figures 10 and 11). Including more design
considerations/targets would also be helpful for the
reader. As the reviewers have pointed out, if at all
possible a comparison of results from a traditional device
compared to this new approach would be helpful. Overall
though, it is a very good contribution.

Comments on Video Attachment:

Very helpful for the reader.  However, I found that reading
the text and listening to the audio was confusing.  I
suggest only audio or only text, but not both.
