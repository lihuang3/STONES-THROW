In mathematics, in the study of dynamical systems with two-dimensional phase space, a \emph{limit cycle} is a closed trajectory in phase space having the property that at least one other trajectory spirals into it either as time approaches infinity or as time approaches negative infinity. Such behavior is exhibited in some nonlinear systems. The study of limit cycles was initiated by Henri Poincaré (1854-1912.)
