\section{My \emph{Accomplishments} this week}

\subsection{Project 1: \emph{MRI-powered Robots}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Copied and saved all Latex code corresponding to "MRI-powered Robots" to Github

\iffalse
Deliverables can be documents, code, videos, plots, experiments, etc.	Save and backup all work [code, data, LaTeX, images, videos].  Papers and code should be saved to our git server: \href{github.com/aabecker}{https://github.com/aabecker}.
\fi

\item I highlighted and added $<$3$>$ cases of $<$MRI-powered robots studies$>$ to the review, including commutation control of an actuator, simultaneously powering of many actuators and Gauss gun design and construction. It's going to be my first publication and I'm excited!
\item A couple of images are added here to show parts of my work.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project 2: \emph{STONES-THROW}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set up my robotics research repository and picked up a fancy name.
\end{itemize}


\section{My \emph{Goals} for next week}

\begin{itemize}
\item Finishing theory part and concluding the study on MRI Gauss gun within one page
\end{itemize}
